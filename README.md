This project is a Python-based script that interacts with the MusicBrainz API to retrieve information about a specific artist and store that data in an SQLite database. The artist's data is fetched by sending an HTTP GET request to the MusicBrainz API with the artist's name as a query parameter. The response, which is in JSON format, contains detailed information about the artist, such as their name, ID, type, and other metadata. The script processes this JSON response, extracts relevant details, and stores these details in an SQLite database for easy querying and persistence.

The script begins by defining the endpoint URL and the necessary query parameters for the API request. Upon sending the request, it checks the status code and headers to ensure the request was successful. It then parses the JSON response and extracts the artist's name, ID, and type. This information is saved both in a JSON file for external use and within an SQLite database. The database is structured with a table to store the artist's information, and the script includes commands to create this table if it does not already exist. The script finally inserts the extracted artist data into this table and commits the transaction, ensuring the data is saved persistently.
